# Detailed Lecture Notes on Version Control Systems

## Introductory Remarks
- **Office Hours Clarification**: Not limited to the day's lecture topics. Questions from any lecture or related curiosities are welcome.
- **Office Hours Location**: 32G9 lounge, Gates Tower (G Tower) of the Stata Center, ninth floor.

## Experience with Version Control
- **Poll on Prior Knowledge**: Many attendees have experience with Git or other version control systems (e.g., Subversion, Mercurial).

## Overview of Version Control Systems (VCS)
- **Purpose of VCS**: Track changes to source code/files/folders, facilitate collaboration.
- **Functionality of VCS**: Maintain a series of snapshots, each capturing the state of a project at a point in time.
- **Metadata**: VCS store metadata such as authorship, commit timestamps, and additional messages.
- **Use Cases for VCS**: 
  - **Individual Use**: Reviewing code history, managing parallel work through branching, keeping feature work and bug fixes separate.
  - **Collaboration**: Sharing code patches, resolving code conflicts, tracking contributions/changes by different people.
- **Advanced Features**: Answering questions about code history (e.g., who/when/why something was changed), identifying code regressions using binary search on history.

## Focus on Git
- **Popularity of Git**: Has become the standard for version control.
- **Understanding Git**: The lecture aims to demystify Git beyond basic shell command memorization.

## XKCD Comic on Git

# Detailed Notes on Git Teaching Approach and Data Model

## Git Teaching Approach
- **Top-Down Learning Issue**: Beginning with the Git interface may lead to confusion.
- **Memorization vs. Understanding**: Memorizing commands without understanding can be problematic when issues arise. 
- **Understanding Git Internals**: Learning the underlying design and ideas is crucial.
- **Data Model First**: Start with abstract data model concepts before Git commands.
- **Resource Linking**: Additional tutorials will be provided for specific commands.

### Review Questions:
1. Why might starting with the Git interface be problematic?
2. What is the advantage of understanding Git's underlying design?
3. What will be the initial focus of the teaching approach for Git?

## Version Control Ad Hoc Approaches
- **Manual Version Control**: Example of making daily copies of a folder with timestamping.
- **Collaboration**: Sharing changes through zipped folders via email and manually merging code.
- **Git's Model**: Facilitates tracking history, collaboration, branching, and merging.

### Review Questions:
1. What is a manual ad hoc approach to version control?
2. What are the limitations of manual version control?
3. How does Git's model improve upon ad hoc approaches?

## Git's Data Model
- **Files and Folders Abstraction**: Similar to a computer's file system.
- **Example Structure**: A top-level directory (root) containing a folder (foo) with a file (bar.txt).
- **Terminology**: 
  - Files are called "blobs".
  - Folders and the top-level directory are called "trees".

### Review Questions:
1. How does Git model files and folders?
2. What are blobs and trees in Git's terminology?

## Git Objects and Commits
- **Types of Objects**: Blobs, trees, and commits are all considered objects in Git.
- **Commits**: Reference parents by IDs and snapshot by tree ID.
- **Object Storage**: Objects are stored in an object store, referenced by SHA-1 hash.

### Review Questions:
1. What are the different types of objects in Git?
2. How are commits structured in Git?
3. What is a SHA-1 hash in the context of Git?

## SHA-1 Hashes
- **Definition**: A SHA-1 hash is a 160-bit hash represented by a 40-character long hexadecimal string.
- **Content Address Store**: Git uses a content address store where objects are addressed by their hash.

### Review Questions:
1. What is the length and composition of a SHA-1 hash?
2. How does Git use SHA-1 hashes for object storage?

These detailed notes cover the key points from the transcription, ensuring that the important information is not lost. The review questions at the end of each section are designed to reinforce the learning and ensure understanding of the concepts discussed.
# Detailed Notes on Git's Data Model and Commands

## Identifying Commits
- Git identifies different elements in the commit graph using hexadecimal ID strings.
- Example ID format: `4AF32CB...`
- These IDs are not human-friendly due to their length and non-intuitive nature.

## References in Git
- In addition to objects, Git maintains a set of references.
- References are a map from string to string, providing human-readable names to IDs.
- Example of a human-readable name: `fix-encoding-bug`.
- References allow users to refer to commits by name (e.g., `fix-bug`) rather than by long hexadecimal hashes.

## Immutability of the Commit Graph
- The commit graph in Git is immutable.
- New commits can be added, but existing ones cannot be altered.
- References, however, are mutable and can be updated to point to new commits.

## Git's Design for History
- History is modeled as trees of trees and blobs.
- Snapshots are called commits and are chained together.
- References can point to particular nodes in the graph.

## Git Repository Components
- A Git repository consists of objects and references.
- Git command-line commands are essentially manipulations of either objects or references.

## Interacting with Git via the Command Line
- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
  - `initialized empty Git repository in [path]/.git`
  - The `.git` directory contains all of Git's internal data.
- `ls -a`: Shows hidden files, including the `.git` directory.
- `git help [command]`: Provides help on a specific Git command.

## Understanding the Current State of a Repository
- `git status`: Indicates the current state of the repository.
- A fresh repository will display `no commits yet`.

## Adding Snapshots to the Repository
- `git snapshot` and similar commands do not exist because Git allows flexibility in choosing changes to include in the next snapshot.
- Users can create files and then take snapshots of the current directory state to represent project states.

# Review Questions
1. What format does Git use to uniquely identify elements in the commit graph?
2. What is the purpose of references in Git, and how do they relate to IDs?
3. Explain the difference in mutability between the commit graph and references in Git.
4. What does the `git init` command do?
5. How can you find out what is going on in a Git repository using the command line?
6. Why doesn't Git have a `git snapshot` command?

# Detailed Git Concepts Notes

## Staging Area
- Git uses a concept called **staging area**.
- It's how you tell Git which changes to include in the next snapshot (commit).
- Changes in the staging area are ready to be committed to the repository history.

## Checking Status and Adding Files
- `git status` shows the state of the working directory and staging area.
- Untracked files are new files that Git isn't watching.
- `git add <file>` moves files to the staging area (tracked by Git).

## Committing Changes
- `git commit` takes a snapshot of the staging area.
- It prompts for a commit message via a text editor.
- Writing high-quality commit messages is crucial for understanding history.
- Guide for commit messages can be found in the lecture notes.

## Understanding Commits
- After committing, Git provides a hash (SHA-1) for the commit.
- The hash represents the entire commit, not just individual files.
- `git log` displays the commit history for the repository.

## Exploring Git Internals
- `git cat-file -p <hash>` prints the contents of the commit or object.
- This command is used for exploring Git's internal data structures (objects in the object store).

## Why `git add` is Necessary
- `git add` allows for granular control over what goes into a commit.
- It's possible to commit all changes to tracked files with `git commit -a`.
- Staging area helps separate different changes into distinct commits.
- Example use cases:
  - Implementing features separately.
  - Committing a bug fix without including debug statements.

## Additional Notes
- Unwanted files like logs, object files (`.o`, `.obj`) should not be included in snapshots.
- There are Git commands to exclude specific changes or files when committing.

10. How does `git commit -a` differ from `git add` followed by `git commit`?
# Git Log Command Overview

## Version History Visualization with `git log`

- `git log` command is used to view the version history.
- By default, it presents a flattened version of version history.
- The flattened history linearizes the graph, showing commits in order.

## Alternative Use of `git log`

- A more intuitive way to use `git log` is with arguments that display the history as a graph.
- The lecturer provides a "magic incantation" of flags to use with `git log` for a graphical view but suggests reading the documentation for detailed flag explanations.

## Creating a New Snapshot

- Adding a new line to `hello.txt` file and running `cat hello.txt` to display the contents.
- Attempting to commit with `git commit` results in a message indicating no changes are staged for commit.
- The necessity of using `git add hello.txt` to stage changes before committing.
- Committing the staged change with a commit message.
- The commit adds another node to the history, displayed with a hash.

## Visualizing Commit History

- After the new commit, running `git log` with the graph arguments shows a more complex graph.
- The graph is shown vertically, with more recent commits at the top, including commit hash and metadata.

## Understanding References: `master` and `HEAD`

- `master` is a reference created by default, usually representing the main branch of development.
- `master` acts as a pointer to the most recent commit.
- `HEAD` is a special reference indicating the current point in the version history.

## Questions and Answers

### Relationship Between Git and GitHub

- GitHub is a repository host for Git, but Git is independent of GitHub.
- Git can be used without GitHub, and there are alternative repository providers like Bitbucket or GitLab.
- GitHub requires an account for hosting Git repositories.

### Publishing to GitHub

- To push a local repository to GitHub, a separate set of commands is used.
- The concept of a local copy versus a remote repository is introduced.
- Commands for interacting with Git remotes will be covered later in the lecture or notes.

## Basic Git Commands: `git checkout`

- `git checkout` is a multifunctional command, one of which is to navigate through version history.
- By providing a commit hash (or its prefix), `git checkout` can revert the working directory to the state of that commit.
- Example: Using `git checkout` to revert `hello.txt` to a previous state with only one line.
- Running `git log` after checkout shows that `HEAD` has moved to the pointed commit, but `master` remains at the latest commit.

# Detailed Notes on Git Lecture/Meeting/Speech/Video

## Understanding Git Checkout
- **Git Checkout Usage**: Can be used to switch between different versions of files in your repository.
- **Command for Checking Out**: `git checkout [commit hash]` allows you to go back to the state of the repository at that commit.
- **Alternative to Commit Hash**: Instead of the hash, you can use a branch name (colored green in the example) that points to the commit.
- **Effect on Working Directory**: Git checkout changes the contents of your working directory to match the state of the repository at the commit.

## Potential Dangers of Git Checkout
- **Overwriting Changes**: If you have modified files, a git checkout can overwrite those changes.
- **Error Messages**: Git will warn with an error if there are uncommitted changes that would be overwritten.
- **Forcing Checkout**: Using `git checkout -f` forces the checkout, disregarding any local changes (destructive action).

## Understanding Head Pointer
- **Movement of HEAD**: The `git checkout` command moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit.
- **Working Directory Mutation**: The contents of the working directory are updated to reflect the commit that HEAD points to.

## Using Git Diff
- **Purpose of Git Diff**: Shows changes between commits or between the working directory and a commit.
- **Usage**: `git diff` will show changes since the last snapshot, but you can also specify a particular commit to compare against.
- **Comparing with HEAD**: By default, `git diff` compares changes with respect to the HEAD pointer, but you can also explicitly specify `git diff HEAD [file]`.

## Understanding Repository States
- **Difference Between HEAD and Working Directory**: The HEAD pointer refers to the last snapshot, not the current state of the working directory.
- **Project Workflow with Git**: Changes are made in the working directory, staged with `git add`, and then committed with `git commit` to create a new snapshot.

## Git Storage and Efficiency
- **Git's Saving Mechanism**: Git uses delta compression and other methods for efficient on-disk storage of repository history.
- **Conceptual Model**: Although git's storage is efficient, it provides an interface that makes it seem like each version is stored separately.

## Comparing Historical Snapshots
- **Git Diff with Multiple Arguments**: `git diff` can be used to compare two different points in history, showing what has changed between those commits.

## Collaboration and Git with Dropbox
- **Git and Dropbox**: It is advised not to use git inside a Dropbox folder, as Dropbox may corrupt the git repository.
- **Alternatives**: Use GitHub or other safe methods for using Dropbox as a git remote.

## Branching and Merging Introduction
- **Next Topics**: The lecture/video is set to discuss branching and merging, which are important features for collaboration in git.
- **Practical Demonstration**: The speaker will demonstrate branching and merging with a computer program, rather than a simple text file, to better illustrate the concepts.

- Commands interact with two data structures: objects and references
- Commands modify these structures as needed

## Checking Repository Status
- Command used: `git status`
- Modification noted in hello.txt, deemed unimportant

## Discarding Changes in Working Directory
- Command used: `git checkout hello.txt`
- Discards changes, reverts hello.txt to last snapshot in HEAD

## Viewing Git Log
- Command used: `git log --all --graph --decorate`
- Displays the history of commits, including the initial addition of hello.txt

## Writing a Simple Program (animal.py)
- Purpose: Prints greeting to user

- Command to track file: `git add animal.py`
- Command to commit file: `git commit` with a simple message
- Commit appears in git history with a unique hash

## Branching in Git
- Branches allow parallel lines of development
- `git branch` command is used to list, create, or delete branches
- Creating a new branch points it to the current HEAD commit
- `git branch -vv` provides extra verbose information

## Head and Branch Association
- HEAD points to the current snapshot and is associated with a branch
- Creating a new commit updates the branch that HEAD is associated with

## Switching Branches
- Command used: `git checkout [branch-name]`
- Switches HEAD to the specified branch
- Updates working directory to match the branch's last commit

## Adding Cat Functionality
- Modified `animal.py` to include a cat function
- If argument "cat" is passed, program prints "meow"
- `git diff` shows changes made since the last commit
- Added and committed the cat functionality with a more descriptive message

## Viewing Compact Commit History
- Command used: `git log --one-line`
- Shows a compact representation of the commit history

## Parallel Development with Branches
- Master branch does not contain cat functionality after branch switch
- Cat branch contains cat functionality
- Example of how to jump between parallel lines of development

## Adding Dog Functionality

# Detailed Notes on Git Branching and Merging

## Introduction to Branching
- The context is a project where new functionality related to dogs is being added.
- There is an existing `master` branch, and a new `dog` branch is to be created from the base `master` commit.
  
## Creating a New Branch
- To create a new branch named `dog` for dog-related functionality:
  1. Use the command `git branch dog` to create the branch.
  2. Use the command `git checkout dog` to switch to the new branch.
- Alternatively, use the shortcut `git checkout -b dog` which performs both creation and checkout in one step.

## Visualizing Branches
- After creating the `dog` branch, the `HEAD` pointer moves from the `master` to the `dog` branch.
- The `cat` branch is also mentioned, indicating there was a parallel feature development.

## Adding Functionality
- A `dog` function is defined to output "woof" instead of "hello".
- The `main` function is modified to decide whether to run the `dog` or default function based on the input argument.
- Changes are staged with `git add animal.py` and committed with `git commit -m "Add dog functionality"`.

## Viewing Git Graph
- The git graph now displays a fork in history:
  - One line of development adds cat functionality.
  - Another line adds dog functionality.

## Switching Between Branches
- The `git checkout` command allows switching back and forth between `dog`, `cat`, and `master`.

## Merging Branches
- `git merge` is used to combine different lines of development back into the original branch.
- Opposite of `git branch`, it integrates features from different branches into one.

### Merging Cat Functionality
- `git merge cat` is executed on the `master` branch.
- A "fast forward" merge occurs, meaning no new commit is necessary. Instead, the `master` pointer moves to the `cat` commit.

### Merging Dog Functionality
- `git merge dog` is attempted after merging the `cat`.
- This time, a fast-forward is not possible due to parallel development.
- Git tries to auto-merge but encounters a merge conflict in `animal.py`.

## Handling Merge Conflicts
- Merge conflicts are common in parallel and slightly incompatible developments.
- Git has tools like `git merge tool` to assist in resolving conflicts.
- `vimdiff` can be set up to launch with `git merge tool` but manual resolution is chosen in this case.
- `git merge --abort` can reset to the state before attempting to merge.
- Examining `animal.py` reveals the conflicting changes that need to be resolved by the developer.

## Review Questions
1. What is the command to create and check out a new branch in one step?
2. After creating a new branch, what branch does the `HEAD` pointer refer to?
3. How do you stage changes for a commit in Git?
4. What is the difference between a "fast forward" merge and a merge with conflicts?
5. What tool can be set up to resolve merge conflicts in Git?
6. How do you abort a merge that has resulted in conflicts?
7. What does it mean when Git history forks?

# Detailed Notes on Git Conflict Resolution and Remotes

## Git Conflict Resolution
- **Conflict Markers:** Indicators in a file showing where Git detected conflicts during a merge.
  - `(` and `)` brackets, as well as the `=` sign, are used as conflict markers.
  - They show the programmer where the original code was (`this is where you were`) and what is being merged in (`this is the thing you're trying to merge in`).

### Resolving Conflicts
1. **Identify Conflict Markers:** Find the sections in the code where Git indicates a conflict.
2. **Modify Code:** Manually adjust the code to resolve the conflict.
   - Example adjustments include changing conflicting lines to an `if`, `else if`, or `else` block for correctness.
3. **Delete Conflict Markers:** Remove the markers after resolution.
4. **Save File:** After fixing the issues, save the changes.
5. **Complete Merge:**
   - Use `git merge --continue` to tell Git that conflicts are resolved.
   - Re-add the file (e.g., `animal.py`) to confirm fixes.
   - Provide a commit message for the new merge commit.

### Post-Resolution
- **Git History:** The history now includes a merge commit that represents the combination of the functionalities from both branches (dog and cat).
- **Running Code:** After merging, running `animal.py` with different arguments (`cat`, `dog`, or others) will execute the respective functionality.

## Git Remotes
- **Purpose:** Git remotes enable collaboration with others by managing different copies of a repository.

### Concepts
- **Repository Copy:** The `.git` folder contains a full copy of the project history.
- **Remotes:** Clones of the repository that are aware of each other.

### Configuration
- **Git Remote Command:** Lists all remotes that the current repository is aware of.
- **Adding Remotes:** Use `git remote add` to make the local repository aware of a remote (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab).
   - By convention, the name `origin` is often used for the primary remote.
   - Example: `git remote add origin [URL]`, where `[URL]` is the path to the remote repository.

### Commands for Interacting with Remotes
- **Git Push:** Sends changes from the local computer to the remote.
  - Syntax: `git push [remote name] [local branch name]:[remote branch name]`
  - Updates or creates a new branch on the remote with the changes from the local branch.

### Practical Demonstration
- **Creating a Remote Locally:**
  - A new directory (e.g., `remote`) is created and initialized with `git init --bare`, though this is not typically needed for regular use.
- **Making Local Repository Aware of Remote:**
  - The `git remote add` command is used to add the new directory as a remote.

# Review Questions
1. What are conflict markers in Git, and how are they used?
2. What steps should be followed to resolve a merge conflict in Git?
3. How can a programmer complete a merge after resolving conflicts?
4. What is the purpose of Git remotes, and how are they configured?
5. What is the standard convention for naming the primary remote, and what command is used to add it?
6. How do you send changes from your local repository to a remote?

# Git Push and Fetch Workflow

## Git Push Command
- The `git push` command takes a remote name and a branch name.
  - It creates or updates a branch on the remote repository to match the local branch.
  - Example command: `git push origin master:master`
    - This pushes the local `master` branch to the `origin` remote, creating/updating the `master` branch on the remote.

## Viewing Git History
- The `git log` command shows the commit history.
  - HEAD is shown in blue, representing the current branch.
  - Local branches are shown in green.
  - Remote branch references are shown in red.

## Making Updates and Committing
- Update files locally and stage them using `git add`.
- Commit changes with `git commit -m "message"`.
  - The `-m` flag allows adding a commit message inline.

## Visualizing Branches
- Use a graphical history viewer to see branches and commits.
  - The graph shows the divergence between local and remote branches.
  - `origin/master` will lag behind if new commits are made locally but not yet pushed.

## Git Clone Command
- The `git clone` command creates a local copy of a remote repository.
  - Syntax: `git clone [URL] [folder name]`
  - Example: cloning a remote directory into a folder named `demo2`.

## Interacting with Remotes
- Two different machines (or users) can have their own copies of the repository and interact with the same remote.

## Synchronizing Changes
- To share local changes with the remote, use `git push`.
  - Can set up tracking to simplify the push command:
    - `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master`
    - Afterwards, just `git push` is needed without additional arguments.

## Pulling Updates from Remote
- `git fetch` is used to retrieve changes from the remote.
  - Updates the local references but does not merge changes into the local branch.
  - After fetching, the history will show updates from the remote.

# Detailed Notes on Advanced Git Functionality

## Interactive Staging
- Interactive staging is considered a useful feature in Git.

## Git Blame
- The `git blame` command is used to determine who edited a specific line of a file.
- It can also identify the commit associated with the changes made to that line.
- Useful for understanding the history and reasoning behind code changes.
- Example given of using `git blame` on a `config.yml` file in a class website repository.

## Git Show
- The `git show` command provides information about a specific commit.
- It shows the commit message and the actual changes introduced in that commit.
- Example of tracking a `collections` line change which was revealed by `git show`.

## Git Stash
- The `git stash` command is used to temporarily shelve changes made to a working directory.
- It reverts the working directory to the state of the last commit.
- Stashed changes are not deleted but saved.
- `git stash pop` is used to reapply the saved changes.
- Example provided where changes in `hello.txt` were stashed and then reapplied.

## Git Bisect
- `git bisect` is a tool for automated binary searching through Git history.
- It helps in identifying the commit that introduced a bug or regression.
- Can be automated with scripts, such as unit tests, to determine good or bad commits.
- Useful for large projects with extensive commit histories.

## Gitignore File
- `.gitignore` is used to tell Git to ignore specified files or patterns.
- Prevents unnecessary files from cluttering the git status.
- Example given of ignoring `.ds_store` and `*.o` files.
- Gitignore should be tracked using Git.

## Additional Topics
- Graphical clients for Git exist, but the preference in the lecture is for the command line tool.
- Shell integration can show Git status information in the shell prompt to avoid repeatedly using `git status`.

# Detailed Notes on Git Repository Management and Features

## Repository Summary
- The repository summary shows the current branch checked out, modified files, or untracked files.

## Shell Integration
- There is a link in the lecture notes for shell integration.
- The integration displays Git-related information in the shell prompt.

## Text Editor Integration
- Example: Vim with Git plugin.
- Plugin allows for various Git functionalities, like Git blame within the editor.
- The plugin improves efficiency and focus by isolating relevant file information.

## Git Blame Feature in Plugins
- Viewing Git blame information is faster within a plugin.
- Git blame in the plugin allows for direct inspection of commits in the text editor.
- It hides all the other files except for the one being examined.

## Learning Git
- The lecture provides a basic introduction to Git.
- Emphasis on understanding the underlying data model, objects, references, and how Git models history.
- Introduction to basic Git commands.
- To become proficient, a book titled "ProGit" is recommended, available for free.

## Additional Resources
- "ProGit" book covers in-depth Git usage for software projects and contributing to GitHub.
- Exercises are available for practice, offering interesting and challenging problems.

## Git's Model of History
- Git's history is not a linear sequence of snapshots.
- Git uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to model history.

## Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Details
- Each snapshot in Git has one or more parents.
- Snapshots trace back to the state that preceded them.
- Git allows for branching and merging.

## Branching and Merging
- Git supports parallel development through branching.
- Branching allows working on different features or bug fixes separately.
- Separate branches can be created for features and bug fixes.

## Example of Branching
- Base project snapshot can lead to a new feature in one branch.
- The same base can lead to a bug fix in another branch.

## Merging
- Merging combines changes from different branches.
- A new snapshot can be created by merging features and bug fixes.
- Merging can result in merge conflicts, which need to be resolved.

## Merge Conflicts
- Conflicts occur when merging parallel branches with incompatible changes.
- Git attempts to auto-merge, but manual resolution may be required.

# Detailed Notes on Git Concepts from the Transcription

## Git's Merge Conflict Reporting
- Git retains all important changes.
- If confused, Git reports a merge conflict.
- The programmer must resolve concurrent changes to the same files.

## Git's Tools for Facilitation
- Git provides tools to assist in addressing conflicts.

## Model of Files and Folders
- Git maintains a model representing files and folders.

## Model of History
- Git tracks different snapshots of code and their relations.
- Snapshots correspond to a tree structure of files and folders.
- Each snapshot includes metadata:
  - Author of the commit (e.g., "Nish")
  - Commit message describing changes from the previous snapshot.

## Git Data Structures
- **Files**: Represented as blobs, which are arrays of bytes.
- **Trees**: Represented folders, mapping names to contents (other trees or blobs).
- **Commits**: Represent snapshots with:
  - Parents (array of preceding commits, can be multiple for merge commits)
  - Metadata (author, commit message)
  - Contents (top-level tree of the commit)

## How Git Stores and Addresses Data
- Git defines objects as blobs, trees, or commits.
- Objects are content-addressed using a hash function (e.g., SHA-1).
- Objects map, storing to disk via their hash as the key.
- Load objects from the store using their ID (hash).

## Git Object Store
- Content-addressed store for objects.
- Storing and loading objects performed by hashing or retrieving via hash ID.

## Git Implementation Language
- Git's pseudocode explained.
- Actual Git implementation:
  - Mostly written in C.
  - Some parts use Bash and Perl scripts.
